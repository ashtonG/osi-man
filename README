OSI-Man, or Office of Student Involvement Manager, a basic web-based frontend to the Google Calendar Events API (more specifically, the Google Event Gadgets API).

To do so, it could possibly use Google's REST API to push and change events on a calendar or perhaps a cgi script that pushes the event into an existing ical that can be ported into google calendar.

Prerequisites (thus far):
Ruby http://www.ruby-lang.org/
Rubygems http://rubygems.org/
Compass http://compass-style.org/
Compass-zen-grids https://github.com/JohnAlbin/compass-zen-grids

Building:
$ cd osi-man
$ compass compile
